building Neural networks and experimenting with them and other pretrained models using the HAM10000 dataset
we start off with a basic CNN model then we try to enhance that model and add a bunch of normalization, overfit control and other regularization techs.
after that we adopt some popular pretrained models like VGG16 , VGG19, resnet, and mobilenet to see how they fare with our data
to conclude everything we make a quick comparisson at the end to see which model comes out on top and save it
